# C++ Lab Exercises

I created this public repo as a personal repository to document all the C++ lab exercises as I learn the course.

My instructor is; Dr. Valeriy Kolesnikov, Professor.

I find C++ very interesting and I hope to create amazing things with it.

I write the code on Visual Studio 2019.
